Hi there.

Before running our script, please type the following into the command line:

---

mysql-ctl cli

CREATE DATABASE fred;

USE fred;

CREATE TABLE tblIntro (ID VARCHAR(255),
                       Name VARCHAR(255),
                       Color VARCHAR(255),
                       Age INT,
                       Movie VARCHAR(255),
                       Hair VARCHAR(255),
                       Date DATE);
                       

quit

./fred.sh

---

When the command line prompts you to "Enter password:" just hit the ENTER key.
You may have to hit ENTER more than once.

Thanks! :)
